Workign documents:
RMD_scallops_7_presentable is where I'm working on cleaning things to be... presentable.

RMD_scallops_7 is my last draft with experiemental code as well as the draft/outline write up.

RMD_scallops_8_condensed is the current working draft.

A note on fishmethods::fmp(method=2). Method=2 commands the function to perform a randomized block ANOVA test.
It changes the r default for options(). Note that. Options will revert back to normal after closing and re-opening Rstudio
